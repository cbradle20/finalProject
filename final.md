## Description
  Our information problem is that we found the tax website to be overcrowded with data. We wanted to create a website that displayed and synthesized the data 
  into smaller more digestible graphs. We planned to create a graph for every single year from 2015 to 2019. Our target audience was anyone that is living in PG County
  and anyone that wanted to see tax data easily. We chose the data from the government PG County website. We decided to use much of the knowledge and libraries that
  we learned throughout the semester. We decided to individually pull from each API and add eventlisteners to each fetch request in order to display the graphs. 
  Our biggest problem was getting the data into an array to be able to create the graphs. This was one of the biggest issues and caused us countless hours of no progress.
  We narrowed out focus directly down to police. We do not think it fully answers the information problem as it is just a small graph and only one agency compared to 
  multiple hundreds of rows and different agencies that are recieving money. In order to work around the issues mentioned above we had tone back a lot of the advanced thinking we were doing. 
  We realized that we truly took far too much thinking into how to fetch multiple apis and add eventlisteners to them. Once we took a step back and looked at the problem it became simple.
