        This repo contains the html front end with the css styling fle, a server.js fle, and a
        script.js fle. Each fle needs to be included when you download the repo.
        In order to work on this repo you will need to pull and copy the repository to your local
        desktop or computer. Through there you can either work on it from your local side by
        creating a local server for your usage or by using an external application to host the
        application through a website. There is one get request and one post request that
        fetch from the links of the PG County website.
        For future development the only thing that would need to be added would be to fetch
        from multiple diferent url links in order to get the years between 2015-2019 and input
        each year in a new array. Currently the system only has 2019 as an array value. The
        script.js fle contains a fetch request in order to pull all the data into an array.
