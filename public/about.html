        Our project is a relatively simple project. We found that tax data is far too large and not easy to read. The website does offer interactivity to create your own visualizations of the tax data, however, we do not think people will actually use this feature. This is why we set out to create a website that creates the graphs and displays them for you. We would create a certain amount of graphs that would tell a story of how the tax money is used within the system. We originally wanted to include all facetes of PG County. This would be have been far too much data to work with and we ended up narrowing our focus to just Police data. The data includes the amount of money spent, payee name, agency name, zip code, and payment description. We primarily used the money spent, payee name, and agency name. The agency name for our graphs will always be Police, while money spent and payee name are not static variables. The graphs generated are graphs that we thought, as data scientists, describe the best picture of your tax dollars at work. We used four different apis that will be linked at the top of this page. We used tax data from 2015-2019, we excluded 2020 as it would only give us an incomplete dataset ending in September. This would have heavily skewed our data and not showed the true picture.

        We wanted to make the use of this website as simple as possible. We realize that we could have it incredibly interactive for any data scientist to use, but that is not the information problem we see. We wanted to make a system that was easy to read and user friendly to anyone that is not technologically savy and not a data scientist. We wanted a simple interface where people can go in order to check the history of tax money usage at a moments notice. There is no shuffling through data sources or creating your own visualizations. At the click of a button there is the data you wanted and should know regarding your tax dollars. See the User Manual for more details on how this application works.
